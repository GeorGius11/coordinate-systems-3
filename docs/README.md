# Location Estimation Algorithms

This project demonstrates three different methods for estimating the position of an object based on measurements from fixed reference points (bases). These methods include trilateration, triangulation, and gradient descent. The algorithms are tested under ideal conditions as well as with added noise to simulate real-world inaccuracies.
